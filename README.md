# 🎲 Tenzies Game (TypeScript)

This is a **Tenzies dice game** built with **React and TypeScript** as part of my learning journey on **Scrimba**.  
It is my **first project written using TypeScript**, focused on understanding types, props, state, and React patterns.

## 🚀 About the Project

The goal of the game is to roll the dice until **all dice show the same value**.  
Players can click on individual dice to **hold** them between rolls.

This project helped me practice:
- Converting a React project from JavaScript to **TypeScript**
- Typing state, props, functions, and refs
- Understanding how TypeScript works with React hooks
- Improving my mental model of data flow in React
